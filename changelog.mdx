<Update label="November 15th, 2025" description="df8af4e" tags={["New Features"]}>
  ## New Links List Feature

  This release adds a new feature called the "Links List". This is essentially a "Link in Bio" service.

  Go to your Monophonic dashboard and click on "Links List" in the "Site" section of the nav. There, you can add links of any kind,
  whether to social media, special projects, merch, or whatever you like.

  Once finished, your "Links List" will be available at [your-site.com]/links (or [your-artist-name].monophonic.site).
