Monophonic websites will display a "social menu" of social media links if you create those links.

To do so, log into your dashboard and click "Social Menu" in the main navigation, under the heading "Site".

You'll see an area where you can add links. Click "Add Link", and you'll be able to enter a URL and a "label" for that link.

For example, you might enter https://www.instagram.com/melindaandthenightsky/ as the URL and "Official Instagram" as the label.

Add as many links as you like. Your website will displays these in the upper right corner in the Social Menu, automatically using the relevant icon for each link.
