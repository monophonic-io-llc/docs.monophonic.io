You can apply a domain you own to your Monophonic.io site. For example, if your band is called "Non-Union Background", your default Monophonic.io url will be:

```
nonunionbackground.Monophonic.io.com
```

...but if you buy the domain "nonunionbackground.com" from a domain registrar like [Gandi.net](https://gandi.net), you can set that domain to point to your Monophonic.io-powered site.

## Buying a Domain Name

There's lots of services to choose from when it comes to buying a domain name, and just about any will work. The only thing you'll need is the ability to set DNS records and / or Nameservers for the domain, which is a common set of features.

## A Quick Technical Note

In order to connect your domain, you'll need to create DNS records and / or change your domain's nameservers.

If this sounds new or intimidating, give [this article](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/) a glance.

While editing DNS records is not too awful, if you don't know what you're doing, it is possible to mess up some stuff, especially if you have email set up with your domain, for example. So proceed carefully, or seek out some help if you're unsure.

<Note>We're working on creating easier, more automated options for setting up your custom domain with Monophonic.io so it's much easier, but in the mean time, if you'd like some help with this, message us at support@Monophonic.io.com</Note>

## Connecting your Domain to Monophonic.io

Once you have a domain, you can set it up to point to your Monophonic.io site. You have two options...

### Option 1: Set a DNS "Alias" Record

An "ALIAS" DNS record (which is sometimes also called an "ANAME" record) is the easiest way to connect your custom domain.

Log into your Monophonic.io dashboard, and click "Domains" in the left-hand menu under "Configuration.

Under "Custom Domain: Option 1", you'll see a table that shows the information needed to create your ALIAS record. Log into your domain registrar, find where you manage your DNS records, and add a record with that information.

An example ALIAS record might look like this:

| Name | Type | TTL | Value |
| :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| `@` | `ALIAS` (or `ANAME`) | `300`  | `abcde12345.cloudfront.net` |

After doing the above, you'll also need to create 2 CNAME records, which will be displayed under that "Option 1" heading in the Domains page as well.

### Option 2: Use Monophonic.io Nameservers

If you select this option, it means that you'll manage ALL of your DNS records inside Monophonic.io. There's no significant advantage to this option over the first described above, so choose whichever you prefer.

On the "Domains" page, scroll down until you get to "Option 2". You'll be able to enter your domain name and click "Setup Domain". This may take a few minutes to complete.

Once completed, you'll be able to add DNS records as needed right within Monophonic.io. So if you need to add MX records for email or other records, feel free.

However, the records needed to point your domain to your Monophonic.io website will be set up automatically.
