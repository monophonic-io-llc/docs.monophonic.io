You can apply a domain you own to your Monophonic.io site. For example, if your band is called "Non-Union Background", your default url will be:

```
nonunionbackground.monophonic.site
```

...but if you buy the domain "nonunionbackground.com" from a domain registrar like [Gandi.net](https://gandi.net), you can set that domain to point to your Monophonic.io-powered site.

## Buying a Domain Name

There's lots of services to choose from when it comes to buying a domain name, and just about any will work. The only thing you'll need is the ability to set DNS records for the domain, which is a common set of features.

## A Quick Technical Note

In order to connect your domain, you'll need to create / edit DNS records.

If this sounds new or intimidating, give [this article](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/) a glance.

While editing DNS records is not too awful, if you don't know what you're doing, it is possible to mess up some stuff, especially if you have email set up with your domain, for example. So proceed carefully, or seek out some help if you're unsure.

<Note>We're working on creating easier, more automated options for setting up your custom domain with Monophonic.io so there's less steps, but in the mean time, if you'd like some help with this, message us at support@monophonic.io</Note>

## Connecting your Domain

Once you have a domain, you can set it up to point to your Monophonic-powered site.

### Step 1: Add Domain

The first step is to log in and go to the "Domains" area of the https://manage.monophonic.site. Click on the "Add Domain" button, and fill out the form.

### Step 2: Domain Verification

Once you add a domain, you'll see a TXT record value that will help to verify that you own the domain. Copy the TXT record you see, log into your domain registrar, and navigate to where you can manage DNS records.

The TXT record will look something like this:

| Host | Type | TTL | Value |
| :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| `@` | `TXT` | `3600`  | `mnphnc-verification=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` |

### Step 3: Add A Record and CNAME Record

You'll need to wait a little while after entering the TXT record to verify your domain ownership. Once verified, the last step is to create two more DNS records... An "A" record and a "CNAME" record.

This process will be just like adding the TXT record. Log into your domain registrar, navigate to where you manage DNS records, and copy the values you see inside Monophonic to create the A and CNAME records.

Again, once these last records are entered, it may take up to 48 hours for the changes to take effect. But once the changes have propagated across the internet, your domain will now be pointing to your Monophonic-powered site!

<Note>Again, this is technical stuff, so if you'd like some help, message us at support@monophonic.io. We'll give you a hand.</Note>
