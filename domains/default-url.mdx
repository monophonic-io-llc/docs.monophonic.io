When you create your new Monophonic.io account and website, you'll automatically get a URL that follows this format:

```
artistname.Monophonic.io.com
```

...so if your band is called "Alpha Michelle", your URL will be "alphamichelle.Monophonic.io.com".

This URL is free and always available, so you don't have to buy a domain name if you don't want to, or if you just aren't ready yet.
