Managing your Monophonic site means understanding two concepts: Sections, and Content.

Let's start with Content.

### Content

"Content" is basically your "library" or "inventory". It's where you add your tracks, photos, videos, shows, and merch.

This content won't automatically display on your site, you'll have control over that via "Sections". This way, you can manage your content and choose exactly what and when is displayed on your site.

### Sections

"Sections" are "blocks" that display the Content of your choice on your website. You can add and re-order as many sections as you like. When you add a section, you can then edit that section and choose what content to display.

For example, if you add a "Tracks" section, you can choose to show one or several of your tracks in that section.
