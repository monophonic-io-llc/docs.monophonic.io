## Create a New Video

To create a new video, just click on "Videos" in the left-hand menu, in the "Content" area.

Once you're there, you'll see a button that says "Add Video". Click it and fill out the form that appears.

<Note>
Remember that when you add a Video, you're just adding it to your "inventory" of stuff to include in your website. It won't actually be visible on the site until you decide to add or edit a "Section" that actually uses the Video!

This is helpful, for example, if you want to add a video that hasn't been released yet, so you can get that work out of the way.

## Video Fields

Here is a list of the fields you can add for a Video:

| Field Name | Description |
| :---------- | :----------- |
| `Video Title` | This is the name of the video. |
| `Youtube Url` | A YouTube link to the video on YouTube. |

<Warning>For now, we only support YouTube Urls, which automatically become embedded YouTube players in the website. But we're adding support for more options soon! Message us at support@Monophonic.io.com if there's a video you service you want us to support!</Warning>
