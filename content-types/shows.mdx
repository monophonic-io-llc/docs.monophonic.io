## Create a New Show

To create a new show, just click on "Shows" in the left-hand menu, in the "Content" area.

Once you're there, you'll see a button that says "Add Show". Click it and fill out the form that appears.

<Note>
Shows are somewhat unique in MNPHNC in that they will automatically display on the website, if you've added a "Shows" section to your website.

Shows that take place in the future will appear in the "Shows" section of the website, while Shows that have taken place in the past will simply not be displayed.
</Note>

## Show Fields

Here is a list of the fields you can add for a Show:

| Field Name | Description |
| :---------- | :----------- |
| `Venue Name` | The name of the venue where the show will take place. |
| `Name of Event` | If the event has a name (e.g. Fyre Festival), you can include it here. |
| `Date and Time` | The date and time of the show. Remember to simply use the time that is applicable in the city the show takes place in (for example, if the show is in Los Angeles and it starts at 8pm local time, just put 8pm. MNPHNC will handle the timezone stuff based on the address you enter). |
| `Address` | The address of the Venue where the show takes place (specifically, this is the street number and street name only). |
| `City` | The city where the show takes place. |
| `State` | The state where the show takes place. |
| `Country` | The country where the show takes place. |
| `Ticket URL or Show Website` | A link where people can buy a ticket to the show (or, at the very least, a link to a web page dedicated to the show or tour). |
| `Show Image` | If there's an associated image or poster you'd like to include for the show, you can upload that image here.. |
