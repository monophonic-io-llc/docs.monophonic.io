## Create a New Track

To create a new track, just click on "Tracks" in the left-hand menu, in the "Content" area.

Once you're there, you'll see a button that says "Add Track". Click it and fill out the form that appears.

<Note>
Remember that when you add a Track, you're just adding it to your "inventory" of stuff to include in your website. It won't actually be visible on the site until you decide to add or edit a "Section" that actually uses the Track!

This is helpful, for example, if you want to add a song that hasn't been released yet, so you can get that work out of the way.
