A "Section" is exactly what it sounds like, unsurprisingly... It's just a portion of the website you build with Monophonic.io.

Think of a Section as a "block" on a screen that stretches from the left edge to the right edge, and it's as tall as needed to contain whatever content it's showing. They just stack on top of each other. It's not rocket science.

## Common Section Features

Every Section shares some common features, which are accessible in the upper right corners of each section when managing your site in the Monophonic.io dashboard under the "Settings" button. They are:

* Set a backgroud image
* Set a background color
* Can be linked to in the main navigation using the "Navigation Text" option
* Can link to any URL on the internet with the "External Link" option
* Can be individually re-ordered using the "Move Up" and "Move Down" options
