The Photos Section lets you display one or more of your photos in your website.

Click "Sections" in the left-hand menu, and if you don't already have one added, click "Add Section", and choose "Photo" as the section type.

The new section will get added... just click "Edit" above the section to edit it.

Click "Edit Photos" and you'll see the available photos you have to add to the section. Click on the photo(s) you'd like to include and click "Save".

## Photo Section Options

There is an "Aspect Ratio" option for the photos section. You can choose from 3 different aspect ratios: Square (1:1), Video (16:9), or Movie Poster (27:40).

Once selected, every photo shown in this section on your website will use that aspect ratio for the photo. This creates a clean, good-lookin' grid on your site.
