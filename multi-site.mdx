## What is Multi-Site?

Multi-Site is a powerful feature that allows you to create and manage multiple separate websites from a single Monophonic account. This is perfect for:

- **Managers or labels** — Oversee websites for multiple artists or bands
- **Musicians in multiple bands** — Keep each project's website separate and distinct
- **Solo artists with side projects** — Manage your main artist site plus collaborative projects

Each site operates independently with its own:
- Content (tracks, videos, shows, photos, merch, links)
- Design and branding
- Domain name (custom or monophonic.site subdomain)
- Analytics and performance data

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Site Switcher">
    Click the site switcher dropdown in the top navigation bar of your dashboard to see all your sites.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Site">
    Select "Create New Site" from the dropdown to add another website to your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Each Site">
    Each site has its own independent settings, content, and design that won't affect your other sites.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch Between Sites">
    Use the site switcher to quickly navigate between managing different websites.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating a New Site

When you create a new site, you'll be prompted to enter:

1. **Site Name** — The name of your band, artist, or project
2. **Subdomain** — Your free monophonic.site subdomain (e.g., `mynewband.monophonic.site`)

After creation, you can immediately start adding content and customizing the design for that specific site.

## Switching Between Sites

The site switcher is located in the top navigation bar of your dashboard. Click it to:

- View all your sites at a glance
- Quickly switch to a different site
- Create a new site
- See which site you're currently managing

<Note>When you switch sites, the entire dashboard updates to show that site's content, design settings, and analytics.</Note>

## Site Independence

Each site you create is completely independent:

  <Card title="Separate Content" icon="layer-group">
    Content added to one site doesn't appear on other sites. Each site has its own tracks, videos, shows, photos, merch, and links.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unique Design" icon="palette">
    Colors, fonts, logos, and styling are specific to each site. You can have completely different looks for each project.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Individual Domains" icon="globe">
    Each site can have its own custom domain or monophonic.site subdomain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Isolated Analytics" icon="chart-line">
    View analytics and visitor data separately for each site to track performance individually.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
