## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Monophonic.io?" icon="page">
    Monophonic.io is the easiest way for bands, musicians, stand-up comics, and artists of all kinds to create a simple website.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No, literally, what is 'Monophonic.io'?" icon="face-thinking">
    Monophonic.io is pronounced "Monophonic". Monophonic audio is a "single channel" of audio, i.e. it is _not_ stereo. It's a thinly veiled reference to the fact that Monophonic.io creates single page websites, but more broadly, it's a nod to the fact that we're singularly focused on helping bands and artists.

  <Accordion title="Why choose Monophonic.io over other site builders?" icon="ballot-check">
    Well, you might not! But we have a particular philosophy on how a website should work for musicians:
    #### It should be as easy and as quick as possible to get your site launched
    It's possible to create a new website with Monophonic.io in less than 10 minutes, seriously.
    #### It should be as affordable as possible
    Our monthly plan is \$6.99/month, and the yearly plan is \$69.99/year. Other services cost two and even three times as much, it's a bit silly.
    #### Your site should do stuff a band needs
    Some other options offer tons of features that, as a band or artist, you probably will never ever touch.

    Plus, we offer features that other site builders will probably never build for you, because Monophonic.io is specifically for artists.

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own domain?" icon="browser">
    Yup! And we don't charge extra for it either.
    
    Once you create an account, you can go to the "Domains" area and set up your domain for your Monophonic.io website. You'll need to create some DNS records to complete the process... if you have questions, check out [this page](/domains/custom-domain).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I don't have my own domain?" icon="face-fearful">
    It's not a problem... every new account gets a Monophonic.site url right away that looks like this: artistname.monophonic.site.

    You can use that as long as you want, and you can replace it with a domain you purchase elsewhere any time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much does Monophonic.io cost?" icon="money-bill">
    It's \$6.99/month, or you can pay annually to save a few bucks. That's \$69.99/year.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a free trial?" icon="calendar-days">
    Yup! You get 14 days for free to check things out and see if it works for you.

  <Accordion title="Why is everything purple?" icon="dove">
    Purple was good enough for Prince so it's good enough for us.
