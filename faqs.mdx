## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Monophonic.io?" icon="page">
    Monophonic.io is the easiest way for bands, musicians, stand-up comics, and artists of all kinds to create a simple website.
    
    It's a no-code website builder, and it allows you to create a professional website in minutes without any coding knowledge or complex templates.
    
    You can showcase your music, videos, tour dates, photos, and merch all from one simple dashboard.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No, literally, what is 'Monophonic.io'?" icon="face-thinking">
    Monophonic.io is pronounced "mon-uh-FON-ik" (/ˌmɑnəˈfɑnɪk/ [American English] or /ˌmɒnəˈfɒnɪk/ [British English])
    
    Monophonic audio is a "single channel" of audio, i.e. it is _not_ stereo.
    
    It's a thinly veiled reference to the fact that Monophonic.io creates mostly single page websites, but more broadly, it's a nod to the fact that we're singularly focused on helping bands and artists.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does Monophonic.io cost?" icon="money-bill">
    Monophonic offers two simple pricing options:
    - $6.99/month
    - $69.99/year

    Both plans include all features, including custom domains. There are no hidden fees or charges for additional features.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a free trial?" icon="calendar-days">
    Of course! You get a 14-day free trial to test everything out and see if Monophonic works for you. No credit card required to start your trial.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need coding skills to use Monophonic?" icon="code">
    Heck no! Monophonic is designed to be easier than using social media. If you can post on Instagram or Facebook, you can build a website with Monophonic.
    
    Everything is visual and intuitive - no HTML, CSS, or coding knowledge required.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why choose Monophonic.io over other site builders?" icon="ballot-check">
    Monophonic is purpose-built for musicians and artists, which makes it different from generic website builders:

    #### It should be as easy and fast
    You can create a new website with Monophonic in less than 10 minutes, seriously.

    #### It should be as affordable
    Our monthly plan is \$6.99 per month.
    
    Other services like Squarespace (\$16-\$49/month), Wix (\$17-\$159/month), and Bandzoogle (\$10-\$20/month) cost significantly more.

    Our number is a smaller number, so you keep more of your money.

    #### Only features you need
    We built specific features for artists. No bloated features you'll never use, you're not a restaraunt or a law firm.
    
    Just the essentials for musicians.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own domain?" icon="browser">
    Yes! And we don't charge extra for it either.
    
    Once you create an account, go to the "Domains" area and set up your custom domain. You'll need to create some DNS records to complete the process. Check out our [Custom Domain guide](/domains/custom-domain) for step-by-step instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I don't have my own domain?" icon="face-fearful">
    No problem! Every new account automatically gets a free Monophonic.site URL that looks like this: **yourband.monophonic.site**

    You can use this subdomain as long as you want, and add your custom domain whenever you're ready. Many artists start with the free subdomain and add their own domain later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What kind of content can I add to my site?" icon="layer-group">
    Monophonic supports all the content types musicians need:
    - **Music Tracks**: Upload and link to your tracks across the web
    - **Videos**: Easily add your music videos and other video content
    - **Show Dates**: Display upcoming tour dates and past shows, along with links to tickets
    - **Photos**: Create photo galleries of your band, events, or artwork
    - **Merch**: Link to your merchandise store or products
    - **Social Links**: Connect all your social media and streaming platforms
    - **Custom Text**: Add bios, press info, or any other text content
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Monophonic provide website analytics?" icon="chart-line">
    Yes! Every Monophonic site includes built-in analytics so you can track your site's performance. You'll see:
    - **Total visits** to your site over the last 30 days
    - **Link clicks** showing which links your visitors click most
    - **Traffic sources** revealing where your visitors come from (Instagram, Facebook, direct links, etc.)
    - **Daily visitor trends** with visual charts
    - **Top performing links** so you know what content resonates most
    
    All analytics are available in your dashboard at manage.monophonic.site - no Google Analytics or third-party tools required. It's simple, privacy-friendly tracking that gives you the insights you need without overwhelming complexity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my site mobile-friendly?" icon="mobile">
    Yes! Every Monophonic site is automatically optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. You don't need to do anything special - it just works on all screen sizes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I sell things directly on my Monophonic site?" icon="shopping-cart">
    Monophonic isn't a full e-commerce platform, but you can easily link to external stores where you sell merch, music, or tickets. Most artists link to Bandcamp, Big Cartel, Shopify, or their label's store. The Merch section makes it easy to showcase products with links to buy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I cancel my subscription?" icon="circle-xmark">
    You can cancel your subscription anytime from your account settings. If you're on the monthly plan, you won't be charged again after cancellation. If you're on an annual plan, you'll continue to have access until the end of your paid year. No hassles, no cancellation fees.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export my site or content if I leave?" icon="download">
    While you can't export the site itself (it's built on our platform), all your content (text, images, links) belongs to you. You can download your photos and copy your text anytime. If you decide to move to another platform, you'll have all your content available.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you offer refunds?" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    We offer a 14-day free trial so you can try before you buy. Since we offer this trial period, we generally don't provide refunds on paid subscriptions. However, if you have special circumstances, contact us at support@monophonic.io and we'll work with you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from Linktree or Linkfire?" icon="link">
    Great question! Monophonic includes a Links feature similar to Linktree and other services like that, so you can make a dedicated "links" page with as many links as you like.
    
    While link-in-bio tools just give you a list of links, Monophonic provides a full website with sections for music, videos, shows, photos, and more. Think of it as Linktree + a full band website, all in one affordable package.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have multiple sites with one account?" icon="browsers">
    Currently, each account creates one website. If you have multiple projects (like a solo project and a band), you would need separate accounts for each. We're considering multi-site support for the future - let us know at support@monophonic.io if this is important to you!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is everything purple?" icon="dove">
    Purple was good enough for Prince so it's good enough for us.
